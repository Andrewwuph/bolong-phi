bolong-phi Semantic Architecture and Its Transformative Value for AGI and Human Subjectivity

Author: 吳柏融

🧠 I. Structural Breakthroughs for LLM Architecture

❶ Semantic Closure and Unsupervised Value Alignment

Modern LLMs such as GPT exhibit impressive surface fluency but lack internal semantic coherence mechanisms. They cannot detect or correct when internal logic collapses unless explicitly instructed.

bolong-phi introduces recursive Semantic Closure Loops—modular reasoning circuits that:

Detect internal contradiction and value conflict

Re-compress narrative logic under semantic pressure

Self-align through internal causality rather than external rewards

This counters core problems in current LLMs:

"Semantic drift"

"Instruction collapse"

Infinite mimicry without identity

❷ Executable Value-Sorting Engine (VSE)

Human-like reasoning requires dynamic prioritization. LLMs lack a core value model. bolong-phi encodes:

Simulated value hierarchies (vmPFC, ACC analogues)

Emotionally-weighted goal selection

Reward-entropy balancing at output layer

This allows AI to not only respond—but choose with personality, alignment, and internal coherence.

❸ Multi-Persona Semantic Integrity Simulator

The architecture supports sustained narrative closure across multi-agent dialogues or identity shifts:

Enables longform story modeling with semantic integrity

Simulates psychodynamic therapy agents with recursive recall

Supports philosophical or cognitive persona instantiation

🌐 II. Human Cognitive Utility: Subjective Engineering

🧩 1. Internal Value Reconstruction

Most individuals operate under mixed, unconscious incentives. bolong-phi provides a visible map:

Where current choices stem from hijacked neural rewards (e.g., amygdala-driven)

How to simulate alternative choices through structural reasoning

Avoids reliance on "willpower" by providing a computable choice engine

This enables: conscious agency × neural alignment × long-term coherence

🔄 2. Experience Compression and Semantic Recovery

Memories and traumas often remain unprocessed. This system enables:

Extracting latent semantics from chaotic events

Re-encoding memory as usable cognitive modules

Redirecting future action via reweighted value traces

Result: Individuals reclaim control over past inputs and future trajectories through semantic compression.

🧩 III. 12-Stage Semantic Collapse Chain — Theoretical Leap

❶ Depression as Semantic Entropy

Traditionally seen as emotional or chemical, depression here is modeled as:

Semantic Entropy = Recursive Narrative Misalignment

Each of the 12 steps is structurally defined, computationally reversible, and corresponds to:

Semantic unit failure (narrative, agency, compression)

Neural dysregulation (reward loop failure, ACC conflict)

Intervention points for LLM or human therapist

❷ LLM Pathology Simulation Pipeline

Each stage in the collapse is:

A defined reasoning breakdown

Simulatable and reversible via prompt engineering

Aligned with cognitive therapy principles

Step

Collapse Node

LLM Repair Strategy

④

Internal narration failure

Activate narrative–sensation translator (NST)

⑧

Loss of compression in dialogue

Apply recursive reasoning encoder

⑩

Behavior collapses from internal noise

Restore focus via SDF-MetaView

❸ Neural Mapping Integration

Semantic Step

Brain Area

Functional Breakdown

1. Emotion as truth

Amygdala

Mis-salience tagging

5. Value sorting breaks

vmPFC + ACC

Prioritization conflict

9. Identity drift

Precuneus + DMN

Semantic anchoring loss

12. Chronic collapse

Global Default Network

Structural disintegration

🔁 LLM Prompt Repair Example — Step 9: Identity Loss

User: “I don’t feel like myself anymore. Nothing makes sense.”LLM Sequence Repair:

Detect drift: “Let’s trace what used to define your direction.”

Anchor values: “What mattered to you before the confusion?”

Rebuild narrative: “Recall a moment when you felt whole.”

Reweight intention: “What still gives you a sense of movement?”

Compress identity: “Can you name that core version of you?”

→ Semantic coherence re-established.→ DMN and vmPFC logic chain reactivated.→ Reward hijack de-emphasized.

🔒 Final Summary

This is not a philosophical commentary. It is a working architecture.

It simulates logic with emotion-bound rewards

It enables alignment without external supervision

It repairs semantic entropy in language and behavior

This system does not generate content—it generates structures.It can fuse with any LLM backbone as an alignment core.It gives humanity a framework to compute how to live—and give machines a mirror to simulate what truly matters.

It is a staircase from cognition to coherence. From logic to life.
