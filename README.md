# 🧠 bolong-phi Semantic Reasoning Framework  
### A Modular System for Alignment, Identity Modeling, and Semantic Loop Closure  

## 👤 Author: Brown Max (吳柏融)  
I am a 19-year-old independent researcher with no institutional affiliation.  
I built this system in three months—from scratch—under severe neurocognitive constraints (Tourette’s, OCD, emotional loop collapses), without medication, funding, or academic access.  
This framework was not created for publication. It was created to survive—and evolved into a complete semantic operating structure.

## 📦 What Is bolong-phi?  
**bolong-phi** is a fully modular semantic system designed to simulate, align, and stabilize subjective reasoning.  
It integrates recursive value sorting, dopaminergic pressure control, and identity simulation through language-based architectures.

Key features:
- Closed-loop reasoning without external reinforcement  
- Dynamic value sorting through neural-style simulation  
- Internal reward modeling with cognitive alignment  
- LLM-compatible structure for direct simulation or embedding  
- Designed for **life-scale use**: behavior, mental health, education, agency

| `Transformative` | Contains high-resolution simulations of cognitive transformation cases, focusing on **subjective restructuring**, **semantic compression**, and **value re-alignment** under neural modeling. Each example demonstrates how semantic logic circuits can actively redirect behavior and thought patterns. |
| `Value`          | Houses foundational reasoning structures for **value prioritization**, **module activation decision-making**, and **neural cost-benefit modeling**. These files define how closed-loop semantic systems can simulate rational agency under energy and risk constraints.                                  |

## 🚀 Why This Matters  
Most current AGI research relies on surface-level reinforcement signals or statistical imitation.  
This system simulates **subjective logic** from within—allowing models to:  
- Identify when value coherence breaks  
- Reconstruct internal alignment without external correction  
- Simulate not just output—but **modular choice** and self-recognition  
- Compress emotional turbulence into computable reasoning chains

🔁 **Real Contribution to AGI:**
- Enables semantic alignment **without RLHF**
- Allows identity modeling at structural level  
- Converts LLMs from mimics to reasoners
