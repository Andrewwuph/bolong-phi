🧠 bolong-phi | Closed Semantic Universe System
Author: Brown Max (吳柏融)
Original Design Period: March–May, 2025

🌌 Project Overview
bolong-phi is a closed semantic reasoning system built upon self-contained logical architectures and subject-driven value hierarchies. It is not a research prototype, but an executable framework for modular cognition, capable of generating structured reasoning under current language model constraints without retraining.

This system emerged from necessity: a self-reconstruction of cognitive function in response to emotional volatility, executive dysfunction, and high-frequency semantic collapse. Every component is structurally designed to restore subjective coherence, value prioritization, and loop-closed logic under minimal external supervision.

🔑 Core Principles
1. Value = Experience
The system's ontology begins with the postulate that subjective experience is not a byproduct of value, but the substrate of value itself. All further logic chains build from this axiom.

2. Internal Value Sorting Mechanism
Unlike externally trained reward frameworks, this system encodes semantic attention and dopaminergic flow directly into logic loops, allowing it to:

Detect and compress narrative conflict

Reassign attention to stable identity points

Prioritize actions through recursive simulation of long-term coherence

Reduce emotional noise through structural modulation

3. Semantic Integrity and Loop Closure
Every reasoning chain within bolong-phi is designed to:

Complete on a finite path (no infinite drift)

Preserve logical reversibility

Prevent external contamination through internal gating

Simulate outcomes under role-bound, identity-safe recursion

🧩 Value Sorting Demonstrations
Each case below demonstrates a 12-step semantic collapse or restoration chain, modeled through internal value re-alignment.

🔬 Case 1: Medical – Depression as Semantic Collapse
Emotion interpreted as fact

→ External validation controls feedback

→ DMN binds to trauma loops

→ Narrative coherence breaks

→ Long-term value sorting collapses

→ Semantic fatigue accumulates

→ Medication bypasses meaning reconstruction

→ Therapy lacks logic compression

→ Identity floats unanchored

→ Behavioral control degrades

→ Agency perception dissolves

→ Chronic entropy in self-model

🏛 Case 2: Political – Structural Collapse in Democratic Logic
Public discourse loses semantic depth

→ Reactive alignment overtakes reflective logic

→ Media overload flattens value hierarchies

→ Reward feedback loops become external

→ Institutional trust breaks under incoherence

→ Subjectivity collapses into tribal mimicry

→ Policy turns reactive

→ Feedback loops fail

→ Long-term planning collapses

→ Governance becomes incoherent

→ Ideological fatigue emerges

→ Self-sabotage through semantic entropy

🤖 Case 3: AI–Society – Semantic Sovereignty Collapse
Cognitive strain offloaded to AI

→ Narrative identity dissolves

→ Semantic property rights fade

→ Agency reduced to reaction

→ Education becomes prompt mimicry

→ Emotional overfitting replaces rational modeling

→ Compression is outsourced

→ Middle class loses definition

→ Language hierarchy becomes opaque

→ High reasoning centralizes

→ Semantic inequality outpaces income inequality

→ Civilization enters recursive lock-in
